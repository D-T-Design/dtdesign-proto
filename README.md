# David Torres React Portfolio Website

My personal portfolio website, built with React.  The [previous website version] (https://github.com/D-T-Design/dtdesign-react) was also a React app but it was basically a single page HTML Bootstrap page converted into a simple React app.  This version is built from the ground up as a React app, and designed with a different purpose in mind.

## The Scope and Goals

This project's goal is to revamp my personal website as a tool to get me hired at new companies as a Web Designer and/or Developer.  The previous website was designed as a Freelance Designer service based website, as opposed to an online Portfolio/Resume which this project is designed to do.

### Goals
- Redesign code and visual design from ground up for new direction
- Code cleanly and track my work using Github
- Submit website for peer review and feedback
- Reflect personal goals and personality in website content
- Display work in modern website experience
- Submit website for job and/or project applications

I will keep track of my work using this repo, if anyone comes across this please review my overall workflow and let me know what I can do better!
